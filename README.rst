Code for finding stellar cycles in seredipidous X-ray data


In this repository, we collect code that we use to detect stellar cycles in
X-ray data.

This code is very similar to the analysis in `Hoffmann et al (2012)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...759..145H>`_ but it is programmed
again from scratch for the analysis of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). THe
data analysis for that was done by Maurice Wilson and will be presented at the
AAS conference in January 2015.
